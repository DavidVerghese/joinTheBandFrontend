# Project Overview

## Project Name

Join The Band!

## Project Description

I would like to create an app for musicians looking to join a band or collaborate with other musicians. Musicians would be able to post on this website, and describe what kind of musician they are, and what kind of musician they are looking to work with (eg, if their band needs a bass player, or if they are a producer looking for a rapper, etc), as well as additional relevant information, such as their social media links. Some examples of similar sites include r/FindABand, [(link)](https://www.reddit.com/r/FindABand/)(which Iâ€™ve used in the past), join-the-band.com, [(link)](https://www.join-a-band.com/) etc.

### MVP/PostMVP

The functionality will then be divided into two separate lists: MPV and PostMVP.  Carefully decided what is placed into your MVP as the client will expect this functionality to be implemented upon project completion.  

#### MVP 

- Display user-submitted info 
- Have sound effects 
- Have a working searchbar
- Have a post button

#### PostMVP  

- Display user-submitted pics, sound files.

## SWOT Analysis

### Strengths:

Designing interface, basic React syntax, incorporating sound, graphic design.

### Weaknesses:

Flexbox, getting info from Airbase, more complicated React syntax.

### Opportunities:

Reaching out to musician friends to get their input, learning to add pictures and sound with Airtable.

### Threats:
Not being able to get data to display. Having too many parameters in Airtable.
