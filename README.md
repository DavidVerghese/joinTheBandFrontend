# Project Overview

## Project Name

Join The Band!

## Project Description

I would like to create an app for musicians looking to join a band or collaborate with other musicians. Musicians would be able to post on this website, and describe what kind of musician they are, and what kind of musician they are looking to work with (eg, if their band needs a bass player, or if they are a producer looking for a rapper, etc), as well as additional relevant information, such as their social media links. Some examples of similar sites include r/FindABand, [(link)](https://www.reddit.com/r/FindABand/)(which Iâ€™ve used in the past), join-the-band.com, [(link)](https://www.join-a-band.com/) etc.

## Component Hierarchy

In the App.js file, you make a call to the API. You pass this data to the Result, Social Media, and Contact components, similar to how the App.js file passed props to the Birds component in the Audubon-Website. In the Post component, you store the user's input as a property of state, then push this to the Airtable API.

### MVP/PostMVP

#### MVP

- Homepage with user-submitted info.
- 'Post' page where users can submit info through a form.
- Get and post musician's profiles from Airtable.
- Have sound effects... eg a guitar riff when they click 'Post', or an airhorn.
- Have a working searchbar where users can search for profiles based on a certain filter (eg #guitarists).

#### PostMVP

- Get my friends who are musicians to create profiles
- Add a comments feature, so people can comment on profiles.
- Add an endorsement feature, so other users can endorse a musician's skills, similar to how you can endorse people's skills on LinkedIn.

## SWOT Analysis

### Strengths:

I know that this could be a useful app, as I've used a site like this, such as r/findABand, before. I have a pretty clear idea on how I want it to look and function. I also have experience from the previous project with incorporating sound and images. I think I have a good grasp of basic JS as well.

### Weaknesses:

I am not great with CRUD and Flexbox. I will need to do review the notes, and probably recieve help from my instructors as well, in order to make sure I am able to get and post information from Airtable, and that I have styled the webpage in the most efficient way.

### Opportunities:

I think this app would help me solidify my skills with React and Airtable. It'd be cool if I'd be able to test this out on my musician friends, and even cooler if some of them collaborate through this app.

### Threats:

I think there is a risk that I could spend too much time trying to figure out how to sort data from Airtable, and not enough time working on the interface and design of the app. I will try to see the TAs for help with CRUD today or tomorrow, and sort this part out over the weekend.

### Code Showcase

App.js: In the code below toggleFetch makes sure that API call occurs everytime the boolean value of 'toggleFetch' changes. I use
this in Form.js to make sure that an API call happens everytime
that I click the 'make a post' button. I learned this from Jeremy.
I think it's an interesting piece of JS logic.

```
useEffect(() => {...
  }, [toggleFetch])
```

SocialMedia.jsx: 'rel=noreferrer' is a safety feature Google recommends. I saw this when I was reading the console.log error messages.

```
<a href={props.item.fields.Facebook} target="_blank" rel="noreferrer"></a>
```
